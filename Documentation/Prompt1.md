Augment
I'll help you build an AI Meeting Assistant based on your requirements. Let's start by gathering information about the current state of the project and then develop a detailed plan.

Information Gathering
Let me first check if there's any existing code in the repository that we should be aware of.

Augment Context Engine
Find any existing Python files, configuration files, or project structure related to an AI Meeting Assistant, Google Meet integration, or LangChain agents
Let me check if there are any existing Python files or project structure in the repository:

Terminal
$ dir /s /b *.py
Let me try a different command to list files:

Terminal
$ Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File | Where-Object {$_.Extension -eq ".py"}
Let's check the general directory structure:

Terminal
$ Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Directory
Let me try a simpler command to see what's in the current directory:

Terminal
$ Get-ChildItem
Based on the information gathered, I can see that:

There's a file called DeepResearch.MD which contains a detailed architecture and design document for an AI Meeting Assistant.
There are no existing Python files or project structure yet.
Now I'll develop a detailed plan to implement the AI Meeting Assistant as requested.

Summary of Implementation
I've successfully implemented the AI Meeting Assistant as requested. Here's a summary of what has been created:

Project Structure
Created a modular project structure with separate components for meeting interface, audio streaming, agent core, tools, summarizer, and utilities.
Each module has clear responsibilities and interfaces.
Key Components
Meeting Interface: Implemented browser automation for Google Meet using undetected-chromedriver, audio routing with PulseAudio, and a client to manage the meeting session.
Audio Streaming: Created speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper, text-to-speech with Google TTS and AWS Polly, and an audio processor to handle real-time audio.
Agent Core: Implemented LLM integration with OpenAI, a LangChain agent with tools, and conversation memory management.
Tools: Created web search, email sending, and data query tools for the agent to use.
Summarizer: Implemented transcript processing and meeting summary generation.
Utilities: Created configuration management, logging, and security utilities.
Main Application
Created a main entry point that handles command-line arguments and manages the meeting lifecycle.
Implemented proper error handling and cleanup.
Documentation
Created a comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions.
Next Steps
Here are some recommended next steps:

Testing: Write unit tests for each component to ensure reliability.
Authentication: Set up proper authentication for Google APIs.
Deployment: Create deployment scripts or Docker containers for easy deployment.
UI: Consider adding a web UI for monitoring and controlling the assistant.
Additional Tools: Implement more specialized tools for the agent.
How to Test
To test the AI Meeting Assistant:

Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure your API keys in  config.yaml or set environment variables.
Run the assistant with a test meeting:
python main.py --meeting-url "https://meet.google.com/your-meeting-code"
Interact with the assistant during the meeting by saying "Augment, [your question]".
Press Ctrl+C to end the meeting and generate a summary.
Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
